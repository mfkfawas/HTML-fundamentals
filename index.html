    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to
      structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs,
      links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML
      code as websites.
    </p>

  </body>
</html>
