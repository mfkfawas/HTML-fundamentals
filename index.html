      All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.

      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you
      too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to
      structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs,
      links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML
      code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here
      are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to learn how to build a website</li>
      <li>You want to learn how to make a website look good</li>
      <li>You want to learn how to make a website work</li>
      <li>You want to learn how to make a website work on all devices</li>
      <li>You want to learn how to make a website work on all browsers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
