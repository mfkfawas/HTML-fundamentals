        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why
        you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web
        developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
        programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs,
        links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML
        code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here
        are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You want to learn how to build a website</li>
        <li>You want to learn how to make a website look good</li>
        <li>You want to learn how to make a website work</li>
        <li>You want to learn how to make a website work on all devices</li>
        <li>You want to learn how to make a website work on all browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
